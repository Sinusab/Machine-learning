### Bias-Variance Analysis for Polynomial Regression
A Python script that analyzes bias and variance in a polynomial regression model using learning and validation curves. The script trains a polynomial regression model on the `project6data1.mat` dataset, evaluates the effect of polynomial degree and regularization parameter (lambda), and visualizes the results.

#### Dataset
The script uses the dataset `project6data1.mat`, which is included in this repository.

#### Requirements
To run the script, you need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

Install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
